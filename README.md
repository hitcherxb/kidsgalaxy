# Kids Galaxy

In this website, I used React.js, Material-UI and SASS.

- I started out by making a header that will not stand out too much but still be noticeable. 
- I then created a carousel to present all the different events or activities that the students can do while learning.
- I wanted to put some of the companies logos and banners in there as well so I put the logo in the header along with a banner at the bottom.
- Created logos and had them link to the companies pages that I was able to find.
